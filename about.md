This website is entirely static: it works only with *HTML* and *CSS*. It's powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a powerful static website generator, and then hosted and served thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Code base is forked from [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/), created by Barry Clark.
Multilingual feature is based on the idea of [Sylvain Durand](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/).

### A word on Flattr

You may have noticed I use [Flattr](https://flattr.com/), a microdonation platform. It aims at rewarding publishers of content on the Internet.

I'll publish content regardless of Flattr donations, because I want to and because I like it. Its presence on my website is more to promote this system rather than getting money. If you like Flattr, say it out loud.

If you'd like me to add another donation system - [Tipeee](https://www.tipeee.com/), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/), [Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/), ... - please let me know.
